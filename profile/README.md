# kpt: Automate Kubernetes Configuration Editing

kpt is a package-centric toolchain that enables a WYSIWYG configuration authoring, automation, and delivery experience,
which simplifies managing Kubernetes platforms and KRM-driven infrastructure (e.g.,
[Config Connector](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-config-connector), [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/))
at scale by manipulating declarative
[Configuration as Data](https://github.com/kptdev/kpt/blob/main/docs/design-docs/06-config-as-data.md).

Configuration as Data is an approach to management of configuration which:

- makes configuration data the source of truth, stored separately from the live state
- uses a uniform, serializable data model to represent configuration
- separates code that acts on the configuration from the data and from packages / bundles of the data
- abstracts configuration file structure and storage from operations that act upon the configuration data; clients
  manipulating configuration data don’t need to directly interact with storage (git, container images).

See the [FAQ](https://kpt.dev/faq/) for more details about how kpt is different from alternatives.
